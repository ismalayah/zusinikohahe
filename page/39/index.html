<a href=../../family-switch-movie-review-2023.html></a>
It was Mary Rodgers, daughter of composer Richard Rodgers and author of the scathing memoir&nbsp;Shy, who came up with the original book and 1976 screenplay of a mother/teen daughter body switch, “Freaky Friday,” remade three times so far and inspiration for many, many variations, including “Freaky,” with a teen girl switching bodies with a serial killer. In this version, the whole family switches.&nbsp;
Perhaps because of our familiarity with the Jenga blocks storyline of body switch films, building them up just to enjoy the falling down, there’s no need for scene-setting to establish the stakes.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Karisse | Page 4305 | Bulbagarden</h2><time>May 13, 2024</time>

<a href=../../simpsons-fans-are-falling-for-this-terrible-rule-34-joke.html></a>
The Simpsons have been on air since 1989 with Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie having become staples of television for over three decades, satirizing American values and culture and becoming iconic for doing so. The jaundiced family is now a part of the fabric of American iconography, serving as the longest-running television show of all time in the US.

<a href=../../a-five-year-old-switch-game-does-space-travel-better-than-starfield.html></a>
The long wait is over and Starfield is finally here (for those who pre-ordered the Premium Edition anyway). But the enormously hyped title’s launch has been somewhat deflated by a swathe of middling reviews, with prominent gaming sites like IGN and Gamespot awarding it a 7/10. The consensus seems to be that it’s a fine game, albeit one with a number of glaring flaws.
