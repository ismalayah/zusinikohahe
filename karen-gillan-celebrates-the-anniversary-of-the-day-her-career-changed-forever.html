The day it all changed! ❤️ <a href=#>https://t.co/CKL1ooQw3J</a></p>— Karen Gillan (@karengillan) <a href=#>May 29, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=838 data-injectable=true>Much like her MCU character, Amy Pond, traveled through space, though her own mode of transportation was a little more high-tech, with the Doctor’s TARDIS being able to take the pair to almost any point in space and time. She fought off aliens and monsters, saw civilizations old and new, and helped those in need wherever she could. She may not have been as physically strong as Nebula, and certainly more human, but Amy had an inner strength that audiences saw time and time again, making her such an endearing part of the series.</p><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>The actress starred in the show from its fifth season to mid-way through the seventh season, where she met a somewhat tragic end in a shocking twist. Fans loved the actress in the series, finding her chemistry with both Smith as The Doctor and also Authur Darvill as her romantic interest turned husband Rory Williams, to be exceedingly fun to watch. This role certainly kicked things off for Gillan, as she then went on to star as Nebula in Guardians of the Galaxy a year later.</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>She has since starred in massive hits such as her continued work in the MCU, her role in the Jumanji reboot, and the COVID comedy The Bubble, among many others. You can see her now in theatres in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S4or7Ep2SgoZyhrq95wp6jnpqilsGmv4ytn55lkaO7qsLEq6qaqqlivKd506GcZpyRrnqpsdFmmpqqlZq%2Fbq%2FHmqWgnZRis7C%2BxK%2Bcq2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kanchan-gupta-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-648090-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kanchan Gupta Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
