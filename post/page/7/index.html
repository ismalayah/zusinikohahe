Most of the movie represents their court trial through interviews conducted both in and outside of court. Henry’s guilt seems to be assured, given his unbothered body language and unrepentant testimony. His motives also seem clear: he might have done it for his parents’ real estate, because he was jealous of his older brother, or maybe because of his sociopathic admiration for Hitler.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Armie Hammer: Actor, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth !</h2><time>Sep 1, 2024</time>
