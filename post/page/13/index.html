Daniel Craig remains a splendid Bond, one of the best. He is handsome, agile, muscular, dangerous. Everything but talkative. I didn't count, but I think M (Judi Dench) has more dialogue than 007. Bond doesn't look like the urge to peel Camille has even entered his mind. He blows up a hotel in the middle of a vast, barren, endless Bolivian desert. It's a luxury hotel, with angular W Hotel-style minimalist room furniture you might cut your legs on, and a bartender who will stir or shake you any drink, but James has become a regular bloke who orders lager.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Simu Liu will be modelling lingerie for Rihanna, and he already has his pecs set on the next runway</h2><time>Aug 8, 2024</time>

It's hard to tell what Reitman—who also wrote the script, based on the novel by Joyce Maynard—intended here. He's crafted a handsome but very self-serious melodrama, seemingly without realizing how unintentionally hilarious some of his more romantic, dramatic moments are. Perhaps he meant it as an homage to a bygone era: the so-called women's pictures of Douglas Sirk from the 1950s. What he's come up with hews more closely to the shameless sentimentality of a gauzy Nicholas Sparks adaptation.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mia McKenna-Bruce Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</h2><time>Aug 7, 2024</time>
