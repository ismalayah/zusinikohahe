A synthesizer player, Hawkey made a name for himself as the spacey sound maker for nu-metal outfit Deadsy from 1995 to 2007 (per <a href=#>last.fm</a>). The group rose to prominence with the hit single, "The Key to Gramercy Park," which featured Korn's Jonathan Davis. Owing up to the group's nu-metal pull at the time, the <a href=#>music video</a> was also directed by pioneering Limp Bizkit vocalist Fred Durst, as last.fm notes.</p><p dir=ltr>After a decade-long hiatus, Hawkey and Deadsy officially reunited and rocked <a href=#>San Quentin State Prison</a> (we're sure Johnny Cash would be proud) alongside stoner rock stalwarts Queens of the Stone Age. But while Deadsy was put on ice, Hawkey continued making music in the interim and even ventured into Hollywood like his wife, the ever-talented <a href=#>Vera Farmiga</a>. In 2011, Hawkey served as co-producer and music director for Farmiga's directorial debut, "Higher Ground," which received <a href=#>critical acclaim</a> despite an underwhelming showing at the <a href=#>box office</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Hawkey even put aside the synthesizer on occasion to make some on-screen appearances. Per <a href=#>IMDb</a>, his first acting role came in the form of 2003's "The Singing Detective," where he played Dark's Bass Player. His second (and most notable) role came in the form of 2015's "The Returned," an A&E series that saw Hawkey play Paul Koretsky. The series, however, was short-lived and was canceled after Season 1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2pjaX5xe9ahpmaho2LDpr7AZp2aqp2etKK%2FjKGsrJqRo7FuvsSnpWagkay4psWO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-conyo-mean.html><span>←</span><span>What does conyo mean</span></a>
