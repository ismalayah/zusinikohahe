Invincible’s focus might seem familiar to some of its viewers, but it’s not due to its similarity to The Boys—at least not entirely. The violent animated series does center itself around superheroes, and its lead antagonist serves as the mega-powered Superman stand-in, but that’s where the shows’ similarities end.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>A Shocking Loss: Dariush Mehrjui (1939-2023) | Tributes</h2><time>Aug 1, 2024</time>

In the case of "House Party," the musical is a canvas used by the director, Reginald Hudlin, to show us black teenagers with a freshness and originality that's rare in modern movies.
