Would that every It’s Always Sunny episode began in a confessional. “I’m super pissed because my friends made me fat,” a sweaty, enraged Mac fumes to a confused priest before launching into a diatribe against the Paddy’s gang. Just to be clear, Mac isn’t there to confess anything; he’s just hoping the priest will smite those who have wronged him and help him lose weight. As the great and angry God commands!</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Law Abiding Citizen movie review (2009)</h2><time>Jun 5, 2024</time>

Clyde can't believe this. He saw his family murdered. Both men are guilty. On this everyone agrees. Why is one allowed to live? Because, Nick explains, the case isn't airtight without the testimony, and if they lose, both men walk free. That's not good enough for Clyde, who has 10 years to plot, plan and simmer in his hatred. That's the prologue. I won't go into detail about what happens next, except to observe that Clyde's first killing involves his penetration of the Death Row execution chamber itself -- and that's before he's in prison.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Yoshiro Nakamatsu Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</h2><time>Jun 5, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../sweet-dreams-film-review-2024.html></a>
As directed by&nbsp;Sendijarević, shot by&nbsp;Emo Weemhoff and edited by&nbsp;Lot Rossmark,&nbsp;"Sweet Dreams"&nbsp;is aestheticized within a millimeter&nbsp;of its life. The movie is shot in the squarish, 4x3 "Academy"&nbsp;ratio, mostly through wide-angle lenses that cartoonishly distort people and objects (especially when the camera shifts position quickly). Almost every establishing shot is symmetrically framed, not in the manner of a&nbsp;Stanley Kubrick or Wes Anderson, but fetishistic fan art inspired by them. Objects and people&nbsp;within each shot are arranged like elements in a glassed-in art installation.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Lacemaker movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1978)</h2><time>Jun 4, 2024</time>

Marylene meets an American tourist and moves into his hotel. Pomme, alone, soberly regards the bathers. She eats a plum in her room. She has solitary ice creams in deserted cafes. One day she meets Francois, a literature student from Paris who is also alone at the resort. They shyly like each other but lose track of each other, and Goretta provides a stunning shot showing Francois walking alone on the beach as the camera then rotates to zoom in on Pomme on a side street a few blocks away.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Eddie Murphys Beverly Hills Cop 4 brings back a quartet of OGs, banana in tailpipe unconfir</h2><time>Jun 3, 2024</time>
