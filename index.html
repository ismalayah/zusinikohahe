Interviews Dusty Cohl: In Memory Roger Ebert &nbsp;|&nbsp; 2008-01-11 Nobody ever seemed to know what Dusty Cohl did for a living.

Making her feature debut, Adele Lim takes bold risks in her raunchy road trip comedy “Joy Ride.” The movie walks a fine line between exploring heartfelt questions about belonging and outrageous jokes played for shock value. It’s as if Lim and fellow co-writers Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and Teresa Hsiao saw the antics in Malcolm D. Lee’s “Girls Trip” as a challenge to top. It’s safe to say the crew in “Joy Ride” do top the outrageous factor, but whether or not it’s as effective will depend on the viewer’s stomach for bawdy humor.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How to pronounce wang</h2><time>Sep 22, 2024</time>
