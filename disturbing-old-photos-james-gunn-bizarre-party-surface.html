And while there’s no doubt that he’s an incredibly talented filmmaker, his activities and behavior elsewhere have certainly made some folks uncomfortable.</p><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=829 data-injectable=true>Take these old photos which surfaced earlier today, for instance. First discovered by Ian Cheong on Twitter, they depict Gunn at what’s apparently a&nbsp;To Catch A Predator-themed party. Which, for those who don’t know, is a party based around “a popular NBC investigative series that ran from 2004-2008. Using hidden cameras, the show would catch alleged sexual predators who had arranged to have sex with children as young as 12.”</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>That’s pretty bizarre in and of itself, and in the pics below, you can see the director in costume as a Catholic priest along with some young women dressed to look like children, while another shot depicts more of their group and is equally strange.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gunn-2-642x1024.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gunn-1.jpg><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true>Of course, there’s absolutely nothing illegal about what’s going on here. It’s just a party and everyone seen in the images above is an adult (we presume). Still, the very fact that the director’s attending an event themed after a show about sexual predators is bizarre in and of itself. Not to mention that these photos are slightly unsettling, too.</p><p data-characters=557 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=false>Coupled with his aforementioned tweets, it all paints the picture of a man who’s certainly got an odd and perhaps even twisted sense of humor. Does that mean he shouldn’t be allowed near the set of a movie, though? And should he be punished for his behavior in the past when he’s a completely different person now (or so he says)? That’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the question facing Disney and the film industry as a whole</a> at the moment, and as more on the&nbsp;<strong>James Gunn&nbsp;</strong>saga continues to unfold, we’ll be sure to&nbsp;keep you posted every step of the way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6KrpKq%2Fo7XNoGSopJRivam706iqZqKRorK0ecaupadlkp7Hor7RnmSpmaKpxm6%2F1KudmpuVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-tom-cruise-and-paris-hilton-ever-date-internet-loses-its-mind-over-their-new-tiktok-325013-html.html><span>←</span><span>Did Tom Cruise and Paris Hilton Ever Date?
