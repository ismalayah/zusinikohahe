But there is only so much she can say when it comes to promoting her anti-LGBTQ+ views without repeating her own word salad. So, after she retweeted an older tweet of hers that illogically stressed “trans don’t need trans rights,” she managed to find a new object to drown in her bigoted opinion process for the topic — the whiskey brand Jack Daniel’s.</p><p data-characters=616 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Recently, Jack Daniel’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that for their first-ever reality series, Drag Queen Summer Glamp, the brand is joining forces with RuPaul’s Drag Race alums BeBe Zahara Benet, Manila Luzon, and Trinity the Tuck to “put the ‘glam’ in glamping at the Jack Daniel Distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee.” American country artist Travis Tritt called out the company for its attempts at being inclusive — after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">doing the same</a> with Anheuser Busch for choosing trans activist Dylan Mulvaney to promote its Bud Light beers. And of course, Greene, sensing a kindred spirit, had to back his opinion on the topic.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Noted. <a href=#>https://t.co/3oHBfbEotA</a></p>— Marjorie Taylor Greene 🇺🇸 (@mtgreenee) <a href=#>April 6, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>Targeting drag queens is not new for MTG — while proposing her nationwide ban on gender-affirming care for minors, she had <a href=#>spoken at length</a> about how drag queens are “groomers and child predators” who must be stopped because they are “sexualizing children for profit in a multibillion-dollar medical industry that looks to grow and grow!”</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=184 data-injectable=false>But seeing that she looks set to resume her old habits, Rep.
