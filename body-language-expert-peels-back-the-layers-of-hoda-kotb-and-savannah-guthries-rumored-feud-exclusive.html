"Not only do you have to engage with guests, represent the interests of the viewers at home, entertain and inform your audience, you are tasked to do all of this with a partner." Ponce then elaborated that live shows add more pressure because "of time constraints." Working with another co-host is difficult as well, given that the "on-camera presence together needs to come across seamless, easy, and natural."</p><p>"In the instance of Hoda and Savannah, you have two experienced on-camera personalities," Ponce, author of "<a href=#>A.W.E.S.O.M.E.: 7 Keys to Unlock the Speaker Within</a>," told Nicki Swift. While both have years of on-screen experience, Guthrie and Kotb have "distinct backgrounds," with Guthrie being more of a journalist and Kotb more of a personality. "With the right direction it indeed is a seller duo, but without guidance there are challenges," Ponce asserted.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm9lboJ0e8Gom7JlnJa7qMHAoJxmnailsrPAjKmcnqSjYq%2Bir8pmq6GdXaGuurHRrGSonl2dvKWtjKSmrZpdlruledKarZqmnpa1brPUrZ%2BroZWoerPBzKipnpxdm7K2sIyer5ykpai2t7GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beneficence-hip-hop-artist-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Beneficence (hip hop artist)s biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story</span></a>
