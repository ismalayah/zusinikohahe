So, how did Barbie’s lead actress and producer, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Margot Robbie</a></strong>, fare at the SAG Awards, and what about her outstanding nomination history?</p><h2 id=h-has-margot-robbie-ever-been-a-sag-award-winner data-injectable=false>Has Margot Robbie ever been a SAG Award winner?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/barbie-margot-robbie-1.jpg><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>The short and unfortunate answer is no, Margot Robbie has never won a SAG Award. However, the Australian starlet is decorated with a handsome number of nominations, having received a total of six nods by the awards body since 2018. That year, Robbie was nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her role as figure skater Tonya Harding</a> in Craig Gillespie’s biopic, I, Tonya.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=824 data-injectable=true>While she ultimately lost out to Frances McDormand (who won for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), Robbie had another chance at SAG glory the following year. At the 2019 SAG Awards, Robbie was nominated for Outstanding Performance in a Supporting Role, in recognition of her work in Mary Queen of Scots. It proved to be a competitive race, with Emily Blunt becoming the surprise winner for her role in A Quiet Place. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>In 2020, Robbie was again nominated for her supporting role in the FOX News exposé Bombshell. That same year, the actress was nominated alongside her co-stars in both Bombshell and Once Upon A Time In Hollywood for Best Performance by a Cast. While that brought Robbie’s 2020 SAG nomination tally to three, she, unfortunately, went home empty-handed, with Laura Dern winning the supporting category for Marriage Story and Parasite collecting the trophy for best cast.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true>Last year, Robbie received yet another SAG nod as part of the cast for Babylon. This brings us to 2024, where Robbie was nominated for Barbie both for her lead role and alongside her co-stars in the cast category. Lily Gladstone took home the former trophy for her work in Killers of The Flower Moon, while Oppenheimer collected the win in the cast category.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>What all of it points to is a truly illustrious history between Robbie and the SAG Awards, without even mentioning her other award nominations and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hopeful Best Picture win at the imminent Academy Awards</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1or%2BMppirn5%2BperO7wZugnmWVq7KzedaopWaZXaiuqHnAsJirnF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./she-doesnt-age-jaclyn-smith-wows-fans-with-new-instagram-post.html><span>←</span><span>'She doesn't age': Jaclyn Smith wows fans with new Instagram post</span></a>
