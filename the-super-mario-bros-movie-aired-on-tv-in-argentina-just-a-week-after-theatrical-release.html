Such is the case for the newly released <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong></a>. Universal’s adaptation of Nintendo’s famous video game series is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">getting rave responses</a> from audiences and critics alike. It has already grossed nearly $900 million worldwide as it enters its fourth week of the theatrical run. Typically, it would take months for any television channel to secure rights and schedule a television premiere of such a movie. However, Mario and Luigi have already gone on-air at an open platform TV channel.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>In Argentina, Gen TV, a local station, aired the movie in full on its channel just a week after its release. A Tweet, shared by user @therealbuni, has gone viral and picked up by several outlets, confirming the film’s television broadcast by the station.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true><p lang=es dir=ltr>En un canal argentino están pasando la pelicula de Mario que salió hace 1 semana JSJAJAJA<br>Fallecio el copyright<br>Nintendo domado por la viveza criolla <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7QJXW39ho3</a></p>— ElBuni (@therealbuni) <a href=#>April 16, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>Given the film is still in theaters and has no confirmed date of streaming release, Gen TV here is in clear violation of piracy and copyright laws, which are rightfully and adequately enforced in the United States.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>Per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ComicBook.com</a>, this is not an honest mistake on the part of the station. Instead, Gen TV has reportedly executed a similar stint with a few other recent releases. Moreover, Gen TV’s Instagram page has shared memes highlighting the broadcast of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>There have been no official statements from either Nintendo or Universal regarding Gen TV’s deliberate mess-up. However, Nintendo has a strict piracy policy in place. And Universal Pictures, being the film’s global distributor, must be the one to set things in motion if they decide to move legally against Gen TV.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>Given that the film is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the more highly successful ventures</a> of the studio, most likely, there are chances for the studio to take some action in rectifying this situation. Meanwhile, Gen TV seems to be a little too upfront about the deed.</p><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=false>Rising high on positive international audiences’ response, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is closing in on the $1 billion mark on its total worldwide box-office gross. It has already achieved a couple of milestones by registering the biggest opening for a video-game adaptation and is now the highest-grossing film based on a video game.
