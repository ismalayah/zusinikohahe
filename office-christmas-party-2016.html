<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Office Christmas Party movie review (2016)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Assisting in the debauched excess is a rather subdued <a href=#>Jason Bateman</a> as Clay’s newly divorced right-hand man with an unrequited crush on <a href=#>Olivia Munn</a>’s sexy brainiac, who is on the verge of a discovery that will forever change the internet. But first things first, as she and Bateman have to dress up in chubby snowmen costumes and bounce their bellies together on the dance floor.&nbsp;</p><p>It takes a certain kind of film to waste “Saturday Night Live” standout <a href=#>Kate McKinnon</a>’s reliable talents but this would be the one, forcing her into the role of an uptight human-resource enforcer who threatens employees by sneering, “I know why you took a medical leave,” and telling females who don low-cut blouses to put “Dancer and Prancer” back where they belong. She even is burdened with trying to sell the requisite running fart joke, one that actually involves cut cheese.</p><p>Thanks to a subplot launched after a leggy escort is hired to pose as a shy employee’s girlfriend, Bateman, McKinnon, Munn and Aniston end up attempting to rescue Miller from a den of gangsters, one of whom engages in the lost art of mumblypeg for some reason. That leads to a dangerous high speed chase that should have resulted in several arrests and even lawsuits—not to mention the gross amount of damage done to the high-rise that houses Zenotek. Instead, it all leads to an improbable happy ending.</p><p>There are two performers in smaller roles that deserve to be put on Santa’s nice list. First up is Da’Vine Joy Randolph, as an aggressive security guard who probably has the best chemistry banter-wise with Bateman. Warily eyeing the rowdy overflow of off-the-street party crashers filling the office building’s lobby, she alerts him before he goes off to save Miller, “The security guard was the first one to go in “Die Hard.’”</p><p>Then there is the intriguingly named <a href=#>Fortune Feimster</a> as a testy first-time Uber driver who takes Carol back to the office from the airport after a snowstorm grounds all flights. She launches into a spiel about how Carol is an old person’s name that contains a reference to the Pixar animated film “Up,” which provided me a rare chance to laugh without guilt.</p><p>Hey, if anything here makes you smile, go for it. It just didn’t do much for me. But I still can’t get over one cheesy move when Aniston starts waving around the book, <i>The Girl on the Train</i>, for no reason. It seems the same production companies that made this (DreamWorks SKG and Reliance Entertainment) also gave us that early fall hit based on the bestseller. Now that’s the spirit of the season.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46onZ%2Bhk5p6pLTRoqqtpZGoerGt0a2wZmpgZoM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-thursday-night-preview-screenings-haul-in-quite-the-treasure.html><span>←</span><span>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Thursday night preview screenings haul in quite the trea</span></a>
