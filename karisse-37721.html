XDD</p><p>As many of their plays, it digs into the history of a fictional composer named Johann Sebastian Mastropiero, with a lot of humorous songs attributed to him. This time, the story started with a guy going to a psychologist to get rid of his problems, among them having to write a thesis about that guy, and then hilarity ensues as many other stories are told. Much funnier than it sounds.
