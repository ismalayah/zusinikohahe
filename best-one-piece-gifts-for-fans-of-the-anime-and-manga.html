However,&nbsp;One Piece: Pirate Recipes&nbsp;makes a lot of sense as the franchise features several yummy-looking food. Plus, this cookbook stands out from the pack as it is written by Sanji. He is the in-universe character who cooks for Luffy and his crew, and many of the recipes and descriptions in the book capture the character’s fun personality. It also includes fun&nbsp;One Piece&nbsp;art, meaning that this book is fun to read even if you don’t plan to cook any of the recipes.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-9-one-piece-color-walk-compendium-east-blue-to-skypiea data-injectable=false>9. <a href=#>One Piece Color Walk Compendium: East Blue to Skypiea</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/One-Piece-Color-Walk-Compendium-East-Blue-to-Skypiea.jpeg><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=758 data-injectable=true>One Piece&nbsp;has always been known for its stunning art, and the&nbsp;Color Walk&nbsp;series of books celebrates this.

The first large ship Luffy and his crew used was a series fixture until the gang reached Water 7.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>This model kit beautifully recreates the iconic ship and features all the details fans know.

And&nbsp;Ace’s Story&nbsp;is a fantastic example of this. This light novel franchise focuses on Portgaz D. Ace and Masked Deuce and how their chance meeting led to the formation of the legendary Ace’s Spade Pirates, a force that&nbsp;One Piece&nbsp;fans will be deeply familiar with. Packed full of interesting characters and fantastic lore,&nbsp;Ace’s Story&nbsp;is the perfect novel for&nbsp;One Piece&nbsp;fans.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=110 data-current-count=110 data-injectable=false>It is made up of two volumes, both of which are available via Viz Media, making them super easy to purchase.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-6-monkey-d-luffy-ichibansho-figure-one-piece-film-red data-injectable=false>6. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Monkey D.

Perfectly capturing Luffy’s fire, intensity, and weird outfit choices, this figure is highly detailed, making it a fantastic collection centerpiece.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-5-bustercall-one-piece-art-book-2019-2020 data-injectable=false>5. Bustercall: One Piece Art Book 2019-2020</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/One-Piece-Bustercall-Art-Book.jpeg><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>One Piece Bustercall&nbsp;was a unique art exhibition that toured Japan, Los Angeles, and Shanghai. It saw over 200 artists display artwork inspired by the characters and themes of&nbsp;One Piece,&nbsp;acting as a beautiful tribute to both&nbsp;One Piece&nbsp;and Eiichiro Oda himself.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>Bustercall collects all the artwork seen during the exhibition and includes exclusive interviews with the artists who created them.

Thankfully,&nbsp;One Piece&nbsp;is still released physically, with each season getting a collected physical release, making this the perfect gift for fans of the Straw Hat Pirates. Several collections are offered, each gathering many volumes into one package, allowing you to give friends massive chunks of this beloved show.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-3-manga-box-set data-injectable=false>3.

Thankfully, the&nbsp;One Piece&nbsp;manga is easy to find physically, with most bookstores stocking the latest volumes the second they come out in English. However, if you really want to impress someone, one of Viz Media’s&nbsp;One Piece&nbsp;box sets might be the way to do it. Each box set collects whole arcs (usually around 20 volumes) into one special box decorated with original art. That makes these collections into fantastic collector’s items.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-2-chopper-s-hat-3d-mug data-injectable=false>2.

It also looks fantastic in mug form, making this the perfect way to smuggle your coffee across the high seas (or from the kitchen to the couch). This wonderfully detailed mug balances functionality with looks. While it can be used as an everyday drinking vessel, it also makes an adorable display piece that can add visual flare to any shelf.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-1-nyan-cat-figure-set data-injectable=false>1.
