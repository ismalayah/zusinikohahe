Here is some information about those in the film.</p><p>The Last Station (2009) Director Michael Hoffman. Cast: James McAvoy, Helen Mirren, Christopher Plummer, Paul Giamatti and Kerry Condon."The Last Station" focuses on the last year of Count Tolstoy (Christopher Plummer), a full-bearded Shakespearian figure presiding over a household of intrigues. The chief schemer is Chertkov (Giamatti), his intense follower, who idealistically believes Tolstoy should leave his literary fortune to the Russian people. It's just the sort of idea that Tolstoy might seize upon in his utopian zeal. Sofya (Helen Mirren), on behalf of herself and her children, is livid." - Ebert. &nbsp; You can read Roger's full review HERE.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmnJmjqXqiusNmmqudp2S4or7EZp%2BenJWXv6K60w%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-att-commercial-girl.html><span>←</span><span>Here's What You Need To Know About The AT&amp;amp;T Commercial Girl</span></a>
