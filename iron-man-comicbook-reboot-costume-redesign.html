The run will be written by Christopher Cantwell (writer of the latest Doctor Doom arc) and will feature art by CAFU (from the ongoing Jane Foster: Valkyrie series).</p><p data-characters=682 data-current-count=1000 data-injectable=true>Iron Man #1 is set to release in September and will mark Tony Stark’s return as Iron Man in the Marvel Comics universe. If you’ll recall, he was replaced by his adoptive brother, Arno Stark, as the new Iron Man in the current continuity. And that story’s pretty far removed from the MCU version of the character, with Tony attempting to lead a robot revolution advocating for AI free will. But the reboot promises to put “the man back in Iron Man” and it’ll definitely be interesting to see how this arc creates an origin story that feels fresh, because by now everyone’s more than familiar with the Armored Avenger’s roots in some form or other.</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>Ross is also designing a gorgeous wraparound cover for the series debut, which he posted on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter account</a>. Check it out in the gallery down below:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EaUvPCUXQAMEZkQ.jpeg><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>With the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MCU planning to bring back the hero as well</a> eventually, it sure sounds a lot like Tony Stark is going to be back in the spotlight again in a big way. And whatever the outcome is, I think fans will agree that more <strong>Iron Man</strong> is always a good thing – especially if that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">includes Robert Downey Jr. somehow reprising his role</a>.</p><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=131 data-injectable=false>But tell us, what do you think of Marvel Comics’ plans for a reboot?
