With recognition comes scrutiny, though, a truth Milana Vayntrub knows all too well. After becoming everybody's favorite national spokesperson, people had a lot of questions about Vayntrub. Fans (haters?) found some photos from the past that&nbsp;Vayntrub referred to as "super cleavage-y," and they quickly made the rounds online and led to lots of hurtful comments. In 2020, Vayntrub addressed the incident in an Instagram Live.</p><p dir=ltr>"Let me tell you I am not consenting to any of this," Vayntrub said in the video, which was later reposted to <a href=#>Twitter</a>.

I am just like, you know, walking my dog and getting messages from people who have distorted my pictures to get likes on their accounts."</p><p dir=ltr>AT&T had her back, though, and disabled comments on their social media pages so that Vayntrub wouldn't receive any more harassment. "We will not tolerate the inappropriate comments and harassment of Milana Vayntrub, the talented actor that portrays Lily in our ads," they wrote in a statement (via&nbsp;<a href=#>Deadline</a>). "We will continue to fight to support her and our values."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGlgaYRze8eeqZ6rXay1osCMsqauZZ6asqV506hkpKafrHqirs6uq2asmJp6osDTZpqopZ2av6S1wKVkoKGioXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-xbox-360-review.html><span>←</span><span>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (Xbox 360) Review</span></a>
