<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Doctor Dolittle movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1998)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Is this material a mistake? I don't think so. Kids have a healthy interest in bodily functions, and if you don't believe me, ask Captain Mike, who runs a kiddie playland in Sawyer, Mich., and gives away an amazing number of Whoopee Cushions as prizes. Too many adults have a tendency to confuse bad taste with evil influences; it's hard for them to see that the activities in "Doctor Dolittle," while rude and vulgar, are not violent or anti-social. The movie will not harm anyone, and in the audience I saw it with, lots of parents and kids seemed to be laughing together.</p><p>The movie stars Murphy as John Dolittle, who as a child could talk to the animals (there's a gem of an opening scene in which he chats matter-of-factly with his dog, whose voice is by Ellen DeGeneres, about what dogs think about people). The boy grows out of this stage, however, and even goes through an animal-hating phase before he knocks his head in a car accident and regains his inner ear for animals.</p><p>By now Murphy is grown up, a famous doctor whose partner (Platt) is in a lather to sell out their medical operation to an HMO. But Murphy gets seriously distracted by his new insights into animals, and on the night of a big business meeting, he's more interested in emergency treatment for an ailing tiger from the zoo. There's also trouble with his despairing family, which has him committed to a mental institution.</p><p>Murphy is essentially the straight man in the movie; most of the laughs belong to the animals, who are brash and outspoken--especially Rocky the guinea pig, voiced by <a href=#>Chris Rock</a>. <a href=#>Albert Brooks</a> finds a nice, long-suffering note as the ailing tiger, and <a href=#>Reni Santoni</a> and <a href=#>John Leguizamo</a> have some nice zingers as the laboratory rats who are brought back to life by Dolittle's first aid: "You want gratitude? Get a hamster." Some of the animals are real. Most of them, even the real ones in some scenes, are creations of the <a href=#>Jim Henson</a> muppet builders. All of them look real enough, and there's some nice physical humor in a scene where Rocky gets drenched, dries out under a blower, and then enjoys a quick massage.</p><p>Murphy, I think, finds the right strategy in acting opposite this menagerie: He's mostly quiet, calm, not trying too hard for laughs; the overall tone of the movie, despite the gross material, is one of sweetness and gentleness. Sure, a lot of the stuff is in bad taste, but I'll never forget Mel Brooks' defense of one of his movies: "Vulgar? It rises below vulgarity."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46dppysn6d6pbvLoqutpJVifnqFlw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-maria-sieklucka-wiki-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Maria Sieklucka Wiki, Biography, Height, Age, Boyfriend,Family</span></a>
