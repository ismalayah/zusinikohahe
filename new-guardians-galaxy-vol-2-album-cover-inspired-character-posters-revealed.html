Expectations are understandably high for the next volume of the Awesome Mix – which we’ll get to hear in <a href=#><strong>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</strong></a>&nbsp;– then, and in a smart marketing move, Marvel has today released a series of character posters in the style of album covers.</p><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>To be able to see these, fans were asked to take part in a cross-promotional advertising campaign for the Ford EcoSport, and it’s got us wondering&nbsp;how exactly that brand could possibly be incorporated into the highly anticipated sequel. Does this team-up confirm that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will conclude with the group on Earth? Or is there going to be a less obvious form of product placement hidden in the movie?</p><p data-characters=512 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>Time will tell, but the heroes will definitely be part of <a href=#>Avengers: Infinity War</a>, so it’s possible that the squad pays a visit to Star-Lord’s home in order to warn Earth’s Mightiest Heroes about Thanos and his quest to get the Infinity Gauntlet. James Gunn has previously said that <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</strong> is a standalone adventure focused more on the colorful cast of characters than the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe, but some world-building still seems likely all things considered.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>Either way, these posters fit the tone of the film perfectly, and in regards to how Ford EcoSport factors into things, all will be revealed fairly soon, as Marvel’s next effort&nbsp;blasts into theatres on May 5th!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopZ6vXZzCor7Dopinq12crq2t17Jkr6ecYn9urcubrKZlk6TDpr6MoqWsqJmnsqV5wqGYq5mTqbKzec%2Boqq2doqh6s7HVnpilnZRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nc-empire.html><span>←</span><span>NC Empire - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
