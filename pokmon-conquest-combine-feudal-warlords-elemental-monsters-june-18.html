Pokémon Conquest launches for the Nintendo DS family of hand-held systems on June 18. The game is also playable on Nintendo 3DS in 2D mode, and challenges players to enter into battles across a variety of environments in the mythical region of Ransei. For the first time in the Pokémon franchise, players take on the role of Warlords who are linked with Pokémon, and must recruit allies to unite the kingdoms of Ransei and unleash the Legendary Pokémon. Developed by TECMO KOEI GAMES Co., Ltd., the game features nearly 200 Pokémon to battle and recruit, including many from the fan-favourite Pokémon Black Version and Pokémon White Version games.</p><p>In Pokémon Conquest, the region of Ransei is divided into 17 distinct kingdoms – one for each of the 17 types of Pokémon.

Along the way, they will also encounter fascinating Warlords and Warriors inspired by the Japanese feudal era.</p><p>“Pokémon Conquest offers new adventures for fans of any experience level,” said Ron Bertram, Nintendo of Canada’s vice-president and general manager. “By stepping into the role of a Warlord who must form alliances to unite the region, they can discover a whole new way to enjoy the strategic battles and imaginative storylines that the Pokémon franchise is known for.”</p><p>Pokémon Conquest also includes a range of wildly different battle environments that can affect game play. For example, falling rocks or spouts of hot lava might influence how a battle unfolds, and choosing the correct Pokémon type can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Additionally, each playable Warlord has a special skill that can be used to help Pokémon on the battlefield.</p><p>To share the adventure of Pokémon Conquest with a friend, players can use a local wireless connection to face off in two-player battles. Each player must own his or her own Nintendo DS or Nintendo 3DS system and Pokémon Conquest game card.</p><p>For more information about Pokémon Conquest visit http://www.pokemon.com.</p><p>About Nintendo: The worldwide pioneer in the creation of interactive entertainment, Nintendo Co., Ltd., of Kyoto, Japan, manufactures and markets hardware and software for its Wii™ home console, Nintendo 3DS™ and Nintendo DS™ family of portable systems.
