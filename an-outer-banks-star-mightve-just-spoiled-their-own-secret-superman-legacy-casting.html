The latest intel pointed to an unknown <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">star of Outer Banks having screentested for a major role</a> in the movie, although that was all that could be claimed. Thanks to some not-so-sneaky Instagram activity, however, the star in question may have just outed themselves.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>As pointed out by Home of DCU, Madelyn Cline ‚Äî who portrays Sarah Cameron in the Netflix teen drama ‚Äî has followed the official DC Instagram account. Who knows, the actress might just be looking to keep up to date with all the latest The Flash gossip, but this action definitely seems loaded following the rumor that an Outer Banks alum is circling Superman: Legacy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Madelyn Cline followed DC üò≥ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XRE0zef5hP</a></p>‚Äî Home of DCU (@homeofdcu) <a href=#>May 3, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=554 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>Assuming for a moment that Cline really is gearing up to join the film‚Äôs cast, there‚Äôs obviously one character who jumps out as the role she‚Äôs likely closing in on ‚Äî <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the legendary Lois Lane</a>. Gunn‚Äôs reimagining of Clark Kent will <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">follow his early days as a superhero</a>, as he figures out his Kryptonian heritage, so there is the possibility Legacy will focus on his youthful romance with Lana Lang instead. However, Lois‚Äô integral importance to the Superman mythos suggests she‚Äôll still be the film‚Äôs female lead.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Thanks to Outer Banks putting her on the map, and Glass Onion providing her big break into the movie world, Cline was bound to enter the superhero cinema sphere sooner or later so Gunn would be smart to snap her up for Superman: Legacy. Until the man himself either confirms or denies her involvement on social media, though, let‚Äôs just remain quietly optimistic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKdln6rBpr6Mm5ino6NiwLWt0Wakop%2BYqcOmecmuqq1lo6W8qrjEnWStoJWev2671qdkrJ2Tp7K1edKup56qnZa7brjEoJicsV2YrrTAyKeeaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-zutara-and-will-netflixs-avatar-the-last-airbender-actually-make-it-happen.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>What is Zutara and will Netflixs Avatar: The Last Airbender actually make it happen?</span></a>
