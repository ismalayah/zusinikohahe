<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>How Rich Is Leah Remini? Salary, Net worth, Career</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Season 17</strong> of So You Think You Can Dance (SYTYCD) features a new judge. After Matthew Morrison left the dancing reality program, actress Leah Remini will take over as a judge. Remini has a net worth of $25 million as an actress, activist, TV personality, philanthropist, and author.&nbsp;On Friday, June 10, 2022, the official SYTYCD Instagram account revealed that Remini would join Stephen “tWitch” Boss and JoJo Siwa on the panel.</p><p>The actress, too, announced her new job on social media. She said in a statement:</p><p>“I am honored to be a part of So You Think You Can Dance’s 300th episode.” As a fan of the show and a huge lover of dancers, I am excited to guide these very gifted artists through this competition. I can’t wait to witness the candidates’ artistic abilities on stage!”</p><h2>How wealthy is Leah Remini?</h2><p>She is best known for her roles as Carrie Heffernan in The King of Queens and as the presenter of the docuseries Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath.&nbsp;The 51-year-old actress has been performing since she was a child. She dropped out of school when she was 14 to pursue a career in acting. Her debut appearance was in the 1988 comedy Head of the Class.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Leah-Remini-2.jpg alt="Leah Remini" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She has also appeared in Saved By the Bell, Cheers, Who’s the Boss?, F.R.I.E.N.D.S., and NYPD Blue. Dancing With the Stars and The Talk are two of her reality TV program credits. Leah Remini: It’s All Relative, her reality show with husband Angelo Pagan, also included Remini’s parents and other family members.&nbsp;Old School, Handsome: A Netflix Mystery Movie and The Clapper are among Remini’s film credits. No, Seriously Productions is her own producing firm.</p><p>Last month, Glee actor Matthew Morrison announced his departure from So You Think You Can Dance on Instagram. While he said that he was dismissed for failing to follow “production rules,” reports circulated that he was sacked for sending “flirty” messages to a dancer.&nbsp;Morrison subsequently debunked the accusations in an Instagram video in which he read out the real text conversation exchanged between him and the dancer. He also denied claims that he was sacked from the program.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Leah-Remini-3.jpg alt="Leah Remini" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Broadway star participated in the audition rounds, which had already been taped. Starting next week, Leah Remini will join Stephen “tWitch” Boss and JoJo Siwa on the judges’ bench.&nbsp;Viewers were already dissatisfied with the new judges since they missed the previous panel, which included Nigel Lythgoe and Mary Murphy. Lythgoe (also an SYTYCD co-creator) and Murphy were on So You Think You Can Dance until Season 16. Only time will tell if Morrison’s supporters will miss him and give Remini a chance.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dp7aktIyiqmaklZa1br7EpqCnoV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sunny-hostin.html><span>←</span><span>Sunny Hostin: American Lawyer, Journalist, Age, Husband, Weight Loss, Children, Net Worth, Wiki!</span></a>
