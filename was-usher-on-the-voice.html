Usher is part of the star-studded The Voice Hall of Fame, having joined the show on five occasions. In 2013, he came on board for Season 4 as a coach alongside fellow newcomer Shakira and regulars Adam Levine, and Blake Shelton, bringing his classic Usher moves to the NBC competition. The “Yeah!” singer’s team made it all the way to the final, represented by surprise runner-up Michelle Chamuel.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>Usher was a man on a mission, however, making his return to the chair in 2014 for Season 6 and going all the way this time. His soulful contestant Josh Kaufman, who he had stolen from Adam Levine’s team during the Battles round, won that season, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">beating out two Blake Shelton finalists</a>. “If Blake won again, I would have walked off the stage,” the Confessions artist <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a> the media at the time.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Usher might have not worn the coaching hat since, but he did not stay away from the popular TV show for long. He returned a year later for Season 8 as Adam Levine’s Top 8 Advisor, and then again in 2019 for Season 17 as a Battle Advisor for John Legend. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The King of R&B</a>‘s last appearance on the NBC show came in 2020, during Season 19, where he acted as a Mega Mentor for every team during Knockouts.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>With how close Usher has stayed to the program, it’s only natural that we expect him to pay it another visit sometime soon, and, who knows, even return to the red chair as a coach again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEor%2BMrqqhnaJivK9506GcZq6fnrCmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./netflixs-the-fall-of-the-house-of-usher-means-mike-flanagan-has-succeeded-where-wednesdays-tim-burton-failed.html><span>←</span><span>Netflixs The Fall of the House of Usher means Mike Flanagan has succeeded where Wednesda</span></a>
