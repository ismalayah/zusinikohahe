But while the rest of the newly-crowned winners celebrated their individual triumph during the landscape of after parties, Curtis instead chose to grab her golden statue and go directly home.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>While chatting with Today, the 64-year-old performer was asked if she stayed out all night partying to celebrate her momentous win. Without skipping a beat, Curtis revealed that she went to the Oscars ball to pick up her award — which now officially had her name on it. After grabbing the Oscar, she apparently turned to her husband Christopher Guest and insisted that it was time for the pair to go home — effectively skipping out on the endless sea of parties.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>In the past, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Halloween Ends star</a> has been extremely vocal about her strict bedtime and how she prefers to be in bed and asleep in order to have a fantastic morning. Of course, it probably has a lot to do with the fact that Curtis is now in her 60s — which undoubtedly means that more rest is required for her overall health and well-being.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>With that said, considering the recognizable side-eye she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">received at the hands of Angela Bassett</a> when Curtis’ name was announced as the winner, it was probably for the best that Curtis decided to pack up and head home to keep the peace. That, and the fact that she wanted to get home as quickly as possible to tend to her dogs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3ornInmSlnZVisLa%2B06KqZqSZqbKzrculsGasn6S4brTEq2Soq5OWv26tzZ1ksJ2eqXqpu8yeZJ%2BnnKG8uLXNoGSbnaOperTBz6mmq6yZo7RurcKtqZ6ro2LDqq%2FTqKmyZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dave-chappelle-im-not-a-trump-supporter.html><span>←</span><span>Im Not a Trump Supporter</span></a>
