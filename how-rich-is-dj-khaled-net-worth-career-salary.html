Net Worth, Career, Salary</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Even though DJ Khaled is a multi-millionaire, he still bought Mega Millions of lottery tickets. On Thursday, July 28, the record producer turned to Instagram, posting footage of himself clutching many lottery tickets for the forthcoming lottery, which is expected to feature a $1.02 billion grand prize.&nbsp;Netizens were dissatisfied with the decision and chastised the artist on Twitter, claiming he had wrecked the odds for everyone.</p><p>On Tuesday, July 26, no winning Mega Millions lottery tickets were sold. This lifted the threshold from the previous prize of $830 million to the present sum.&nbsp;DJ Khaled advertised his forthcoming album God Did in an Instagram video, showing off his Mega Million lottery tickets and saying:</p><p>‚ÄúI hope you played because I did.‚Äù It‚Äôs a billion bucks, I‚Äôm going to try. You see what‚Äôs going on, Mega Millions. I‚Äôm not messing around with this. I hope you had fun because I did. They don‚Äôt believe in us, but God does.‚Äù</p><p>In the caption, DJ Khaled also wrote:</p><p>‚ÄúDid you receive yours? Are you focused? I AM!‚Äù ‚Äù #GODDID!‚Äù</p><h2>DJ Khaled‚Äôs net worth</h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, DJ Khaled is one of the most successful artists in the business, with a net worth of $75 million as of August 2023. Along with his large income, the rapper is a regular on Forbes‚Äô Hip Hop Cash Kings list. However, the gifted artist‚Äôs life was not always like this. DJ Khaled stated in a 2016 interview with Complex magazine that he and his family were financially suffering at one time, forcing him to sleep in his vehicle. During the interview, he stated:</p><p>‚ÄúGod has provided me with the ability to appreciate the finer things in life.‚Äù I‚Äôve watched my family work so hard and rise, just to have it all ripped away. I had to man up, which included sleeping in my vehicle, renting an apartment for a month, and then being evicted the next month. Staying in $25-$35 hotel rooms. I just never panicked. I kept concentrating and never gave up.‚Äù</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DJ-Khaled-2.jpg alt="DJ Khaled" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He went on to say that he now has the wherewithal to care for his parents, wife, other family members, and his staff, whom he considers to be family as well.&nbsp;DJ Khaled‚Äôs meteoric rise started in the 1990s when he worked as a DJ for Miami radio station 99 Jamz.
