As the poster points out, Raimi often weaves the supernatural into the projects he works on. As well, the film does not confirm if the “substance” as it is referred to came from space at all when Peter <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">goes</a> to Dr. Connors for analysis and the writer also says its shapeshifting is a thing demons can do, while Tom Hardy’s version of Venom does not seem to have the skill. Others in the replies dismiss the idea and point out many of the bits in the film come from comics, while, for another — though it may not have merit — there is definitely a sort of allusion happening with what Raimi chose to depict on screen with the project.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by <a href=#>u/eltrotter</a> from discussion <a href=#>Spider-Man 3: Raimi’s Venom is actually a demon in the movie.</a><br>in <a href=#>FanTheories</a></figure><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>A different user jokes the symbiote, as it can be seen as young in the piece, would have been afraid of being in a church for other reasons and, for a later Spider-Man 3 fan in the replies — when you consider Raimi <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">loathed</a> the character — the differences make sense.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by <a href=#>u/Haunting_Present_387</a> from discussion <a href=#>Spider-Man 3: Raimi’s Venom is actually a demon in the movie.</a><br>in <a href=#>FanTheories</a></figure><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=660 data-injectable=false>Raimi as of May 2022 has not yet seen any of the Tom Hardy movies with the character.
