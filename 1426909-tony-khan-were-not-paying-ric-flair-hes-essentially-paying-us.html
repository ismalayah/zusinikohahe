He noted that the legend came with a “high-paying sponsorship.” Khan also stated that the company is not paying Flair; instead, the company is getting revenue from Wooooo! Energy.</p><p>“We’re not paying Ric Flair; Ric Flair is essentially paying us,” Khan said. “We’re getting paid by Wooooo Energy for all of his appearances, so we’re collecting revenue from them.”</p><p>Khan also noted that Ric Flair’s involvement did not influence the timeline of Sting’s final chapter, and it meant a lot that Flair was brought along for the ride, as “The Icon” is very loyal to him.</p><h2 id=h-ric-flair-some-people-in-wwe-were-upset-i-signed-with-aew>Ric Flair: Some People In WWE Were Upset I Signed With AEW</h2><p>Ric Flair <a href=#>recently stated </a>that some people in WWE were upset that he signed with AEW. Speaking on Shannon Sharpe on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Club Shay Shay</a>, he shared his thoughts on the reaction.</p><p>“I think some people are upset with me now that I went to work at AEW. I don’t know why. If you’re acknowledging, and you think I’ve contributed to the business, and I know I have because I hear it every day, you would think they would let me do whatever I want to do. As long as it doesn’t affect them. I’m not going to get on TV and say ‘AEW is better,’ I’m not doing something stupid. I’m just working. That’s all I know how to do. They’re mad. Not mad, but they did something…I’ll tell you off camera.”</p><p>Flair recently stated that he would be willing to walk away if he embarrassed AEW or Tony Khan.
